Most existing generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting methods (e.g., pixelSplat, MVSplat) assign a fixed number of Gaussians to each pixel, leading to inefficiency in capturing local geometry and overlap across views.  Differently, **our PixelGaussian dynamically adjusts the Gaussian distributions based on geometric complexity in a feed-forward framework.**  With comparable efficiency, PixelGaussian (trained using 2 views) successfully generalizes to various numbers of input views with adaptive Gaussian densities.

## Overview

![pipeline](./figs/pipeline.png)

Given multi-view input images, we initialize 3D Gaussians using a lightweight image encoder and cost volume. Cascade Gaussian Adapter (CGA) then dynamically adapts both the distribution and quantity of Gaussians. By leveraging local image features, Iterative Gaussian Refiner (IGR) further refines Gaussian representations via deformable attention. Finally, novel views are rendered from the refined 3D Gaussians using rasterization-based rendering.

## Results

PixelGaussian achieves the best performance on the two representative datasets. Trained with 2 reference views, PixelGaussian can generalize to more views.
